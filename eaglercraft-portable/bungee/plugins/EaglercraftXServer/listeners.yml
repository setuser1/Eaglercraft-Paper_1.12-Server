# Defines the list of listeners to enable Eaglercraft support on, each listener's
# address must be the address of a listener you've also configured in the base
# proxy server.
listener_list:
- # The unique name to use when identifying this listener
  listener_name: 'listener0'
  # The address of the listener to inject into, note that if no listeners with this
  # address are configured on the underlying proxy, then this entry will not do
  # anything
  inject_address: '0.0.0.0:25565'
  # Default value is true, sets if this listener should accept both Eaglercraft
  # WebSockets and regular Minecraft Java Edition TCP connections. The connection
  # type is determined from the first packet, where an HTTP/1.1 request will be
  # treated as an Eaglercraft connection, and anything else will be assumed to be an
  # ordinary vanilla TCP connection.
  dual_stack: true
  # Default value is false, sets if connections to this listener will use an HTTP
  # header to forward the player's real IP address from a reverse proxy (or
  # CloudFlare) to the BungeeCord/Velocity server. This is required for
  # EaglerXServer's rate limiting and a lot of plugins to work correctly if they are
  # used behind a reverse HTTP proxy or CloudFlare.
  forward_ip: false
  # Default value is 'X-Real-IP', sets the name of the request header that contains
  # the player's real IP address if the forward_ip option is enabled. This option is
  # commonly set to X-Forwarded-For or CF-Connecting-IP for a lot of server setups.
  forward_ip_header: 'X-Real-IP'
  # Default value is false, sets if HTTP and WebSocket connections to this listener
  # require a header with a secret to be accepted, can be used to prevent someone
  # from bypassing CloudFlare, nginx, or whatever and connecting directly to the
  # EaglerXServer listener with a fake forward IP header.
  forward_secret: false
  # Default value is 'X-Eagler-Secret', sets the name of the request header that
  # contains the secret if the forward_secret option is enabled.
  forward_secret_header: 'X-Eagler-Secret'
  # Default value is 'eagler_forwarding.secret', sets the name of the file that
  # contains the secret if the forward_secret option is enabled, relative to the
  # server's working directory.
  forward_secret_file: 'eagler_forwarding.secret'
  # Default value is true, if the effective remote addresses of Eaglercraft
  # connections in the underlying server should be spoofed to the address received
  # via the forward_ip header. Has no effect if forward_ip is not true, if false
  # then plugins will need to use the EaglerXServer API to determine the forwarded
  # IP address of an Eaglercraft player.
  spoof_player_address_forwarded: true
  # Default value is false, if HAProxy auto-detection should be enabled on this
  # listener, if true then the first packet will be checked for a HAProxy PROXY
  # protocol header, and will automatically disable HAProxy for the channel if it is
  # not present. You must enable HAProxy on the underlying BungeeCord/Velocity
  # listener for this to work properly.
  dual_stack_haproxy_detection: false
  # Default value is false, if HAProxy should be forcefully disabled when its
  # detected on a channel from this listener. Can be useful if the underlying server
  # does not allow disabling HAProxy on a per-listener basis (like Velocity).
